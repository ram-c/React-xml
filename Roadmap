1. Add full unicode (wide character) support to Xml::Parser - ifstream -> wide version.
2. Polish Xml::DOM api
2.1. Make Xml::Parser object copyable. This will help in implementing Xml::Reactor::DomifySelf. Also there will be no need of SaveState and RestoreState methods in Xml::Parser
2.2. Make a singly linked list for use in all cases where indexed access to a sequential container is not necessary.
2.3. In Xml::Reactor::callHandlersIfPathsMatch, change all non-const iterators to const counterparts.
3. EnablingAttribute in Xml::Reactor is slightly confusing in semantics. What happens when a parent element has EnablingAttribute set to 'no' when the EnablingAttribute for this element is set to 'yes'. Think of making the purport clearer.
3.1. Normalize XPath expressions before adding to handlerMap in Xml::Reactor
4. #pragma once will not work on gcc and clang. Make the parser portable by providing support to build on gcc, clang and mingw
5. Support for other types of Xml tokens - CDATA, XML entities
