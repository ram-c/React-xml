# React-xml
A reactive way to parse XML!

Imagine you have a huge XML file to parse. Using a conventional DOM based parser means you need to 'query' for specific elements or attributes you are interested. How about having a parsing framework or library that will notify you by calling relevant 'handlers' (callback functions) when the parser hits the XML nodes you are interested in! Enter React-xml - the 'reactive' XML parsing framework. You can adapt the framework for your work in any language or platform you wish or just compile the C++ files to have a library that will do reactive XML parsing for you.
